# DotVVM Minutes - Episode 6

This episode shows how to install DotVVM in a legacy ASP.NET Web Forms app and how to incrementally migrate it to .NET Core.

The source code is in a separate repo: [Modernize Web Forms apps with DotVVM](https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm-samples-webforms-migration)

> UPDATE: We have an easier way to install DotVVM in old projects - right-click the project and select **Add DotVVM**. [More info](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR-q5xCNFns&ab_channel=DotVVM)
